<p>An AR project for poster and business card.</p>

<p>This was a project I did with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meganbarkerart.com">Megan Barker</a>&nbsp;for her senior thesis in April 2017. I made use of the lovely&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js">AR.js library</a>&nbsp;maintained by&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne">Jerome Etienne</a>.</p>

<p>Her words: "A visual representation of my grapheme-color synesthesia through 2D animation and open-source, web-based 3D augmented reality."&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/benwilson34/augment-by-color/blob/master/abc-01.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Augment By Color display" data-entity-type="" data-entity-uuid="" src="https://github.com/benwilson34/augment-by-color/raw/master/abc-01.png" style="width: 100%;" title="Augment By Color display" /></a></p>

<p>The poster features white text which is overlaid with 3D colored text when viewed using a mobile phone or tablet (wow!).&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/benwilson34/augment-by-color/blob/master/abc-02.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Augment By Color poster" data-entity-type="" data-entity-uuid="" src="https://github.com/benwilson34/augment-by-color/raw/master/abc-02.png" style="width: 100%;" title="Augment By Color poster" /></a></p>

<p>The business card, when viewed with a device, shows a 2D image as if it was printed on the card (cool!).&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/benwilson34/augment-by-color/blob/master/abc-03.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Augment By Color card" data-entity-type="" data-entity-uuid="" src="https://github.com/benwilson34/augment-by-color/raw/master/abc-03.png" style="width: 100%;" title="Augment By Color card" /></a></p>
